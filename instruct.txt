<h1> Instructions </h1
<p>This application allows patients diagnosed with Graves’ Disease (primary hyperthyroidism) to track their progress. </p>
<p>Often patients receive the results of their thyroid tests without any explanation from their healthcare provider about what they mean. You can enter your test results into this application and it will make a graph to show you how your thyroid hormone levels have changed over time. This application does not substitute for medical advice, but is provided to help you understand your progress. Please contact your healthcare provider if you want more information.</p>
<p>In order to use this application, you will need results from tests of TSH, Free T3 and Free T4. In the left panel, first select the date of your test. Then, result of the test for that date. Please enter only numbers in the fields (no units). If you don't have a result for one of the tests on that date, just leave the box blank. If your test result reads "< 0.005" or "below limits", enter 0.002 in the box for that result. Press the update table button after you have entered all of the values for a date. Then you can select a new date and enter its values. You can see the values you have entered on the "Your Data" tab.</p>
<p>If you would like, you can add a line to the graph that shows when you began taking medication. To do this, check the box labelled "Include date you began treatment on graph?" and then select the date.</p>
<p>If you are responding to treatment well, you should see your TSH levels rise into the average range and T3 and/or T4 levels drop into the average range (indicated by the green-shaded region. You should expect to see levels go up and down some over time as your doctor adjusts your medication. Over time, you hope to see all of the levels converge towards "average".</p>
