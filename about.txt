<h1>About Graves&#39; Disease</h1
<p>In Graves&#39; disease, your body produces autoimmune antibodies which fool the thyroid cells into thinking that they need to make the thyroid hormones T3 and/or T4. The physical symptoms of hyperthyroidism are caused by high levels of T3/T4. Because the other end of the feedback loop is still working, the high levels of T3/T4 are detected by the pituitary gland and it decreases its production of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). So laboratory tests show high levels of T3/T4 and low levels of TSH in Graves&#39; disease.</p>
<p>The medication you are taking works primarily by directing decreasing the amount of T3/T4 produced; in seems to also reduce the level auto-immune antibodies, but doctors don't really know how/why that happens. So, when medication is working correctly, you should see the T3/T4 levels go down and the level of TSH go up so that both are in the normal range. Your doctor may decrease your dosage (to make sure he doesn't overshoot and cause you to have too little T3/T4), but you must continue taking some dose of the medication for approximately 12-18 months. Your dose might be adjusted up and down several times during this period, depending on the results of your periodic tests.</p>
<p>At the end of this time, you will probably be taken off medication, but will have to continue having tests done periodically forever, to check for recurrence. (About 50% of people have another episode of Graves&#39; later on in life, although that episode might occur decades later. Recurrence is most common in the 3-6 months after ending treatment, and drops off sharply after 2 years. You should expect to test every 2 months for the first 6 months after you stop taking meds, then less frequently for 2 years. After 2 years, you should expect to be tested annually.)</p>
